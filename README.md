# Notepad

Recently I've been learning about Qt, it is a framework that is used to develop software with C++. I've created a Notepad application.



Why Notepad? Is Notepad worth using?



It has a simple job: To easily view, create, and edit text files, which are one of the most fundamental building blocks of modern computing. 


Even in this day and age, Notepad is still a useful tool for making quick notes on your computer.
